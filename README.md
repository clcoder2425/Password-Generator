# Password Generator

## Description

This project modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected.
The password length must be a number between 8-128 characters. User may choose to include uppercase, lowercase, special characters and numbers.
In this project I use the following windows method:
- prompt to receive user input.
- alert to notify the user of the correct password criteria
- confirm to get user's character selection to include in the password.
